        </p>

        <h4> International Money Order </h4>

        <p>
            Send a signed International Money Order (available at your bank) for the appropriate amount issued to Runbox Solutions AS.
        </p><p>
            Send the money order to: Runbox Solutions AS, Oscars gate 52, 0258 Oslo, Norway.
        </p><p>
            Be advised that payments sent by regular mail may be delayed or lost, and that they require manual processing. Therefore you should send such payments well ahead (at least 3 weeks) of your trial or subscription period's expiration. You may avoid delays and service disruptions by scanning (or taking a picture of) the payment prior to sending it in the mail, and emailing it to billing@runbox.com.
        </p>

        <h4> SWIFT </h4>

        <p>
            Runbox Solutions accepts SWIFT and SEPA payments, but please be aware that this is an expensive payment alternative as the sender must pay the transaction cost. It may take a while for us to receive and register your payment as it cannot be automatically applied to your account. Payment should be made from a bank account in your name, otherwise delays may occur in payments being applied to your Runbox account. Please contact us upon paying to make sure your payment is registered as efficiently as possible.
